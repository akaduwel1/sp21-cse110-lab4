>3. Values added: 20
>4. Error since result will no longer be defined outside the if statement
>5. Error since result was defined on line 5 and resigned on 7.

>1. Since we defined i with var, it will still live past the for loop. For this reason, "3" will be printed.
>2. Since we defined discountedPrice with var, it will still live past the for loop. For this reason, it will have the most recent value from the for loop. It will print "150"
>3. Since we defined finalPrice with var, it will still live past the for loop. For this reason, it will have the most recent value from the for loop. It will print "150"
>4. [50, 100, 150]. The for loop will scale the initial array by the discount price.
>5. There will be an error since i was declared with let, and therefore will not exists after the termination of the for loop. 
>6. There will be an error since discountedPrice was declared with let inside the loop, and therefore will not exists after the termination of the for loop. 
>7. Since finalPrice was declared outside of the loop, it will exist after the loop terminates. This means it will have the last value it was assigned, which would be "150". 150 will be printed out.
>8. [50, 100, 150]. The for loop will scale the initial array by the discount price.
>9. There will be an error since i was declared with let, and therefore will not exists after the termination of the for loop. 
>10. It will return 3, since the input array is of length 3
>11. [50, 100, 150]. The for loop will scale the initial array by the discount price.

a. student.name  
b. student["Grad Year"]  
c. student.greeting()  
d. student["Favorite Teacher"].name  
e. student.courseLoad[0]

13.  
A) "32". The 2 will be converted to a string, and then added to the 3.  
B) 1. Since it is -, the 3 will be converted to a number and then 2 will be subtracted.  
C) 3. null will be treated as 0, so it will be 3 + 0.  
D) "3null". Since it is addition, and 3 is a string, "null" will be concatenated  
E) 4. Since 3 is a number, true will become 1 and it will add to 3.  
F) 0. False will be converted to 0, and null will be converted to 0, resulting in 0+0.  
G) '3undefined'. Since 3 is a string, it will be concatenated  
H) NaN. Since undefined gets converted to NaN, 3-NaN will result in NaN.  

14. 
A) True. Since 2 will be converted to an int, 2 > 1.  
B) False. Since they are string, they will be compared lexographically. "2" comes after "1".  
C) True. The string 2 will be converted to int.  
D) False. They are different types.  
E) False. True will be converted to 1. 1 != 2.  
F) True. Boolean(2) will be converted to true, and true === true.  

15. The == operation will convert the data types and check their integer equality. The === operation will check if they are the same type, and if so check if they have the same value.
